# Codebase Overview: How Content is Implemented and Displayed in the Browser

## 1. `index.html` (in `public/`):
- This file provides the static HTML structure and includes global CSS and JS.
- The key element is `<div id="root"></div>`, which is where your React app will be rendered.

## 2. React Entry Point (`src/index.tsx`):
- This file is the main entry for your React app.
- It imports global styles (like `index.css` and `App.css`).
- It renders the `<App />` component into the `<div id="root"></div>` in `index.html` using `ReactDOM`.

## 3. App Component (`src/App.tsx`):
- This is the root React component.
- It sets up the main structure of your app, often including navigation, routes, and layout.
- It imports and uses other components (from `src/components/` and `src/container/`).

## 4. Components and Containers:
- Components (in `src/components/`) are reusable UI pieces (e.g., Banner, Tickets, LoginForm).
- Containers (in `src/container/`) often manage state and logic, and compose multiple components.
- These components use Bootstrap and custom CSS classes for styling, and may use inline styles.

## 5. Data and Logic:
- Data may come from static files (like `src/data/data.json`), APIs, or GraphQL queries (see `src/graphql/`).
- State management and logic are handled in React components or containers.

## 6. Display in Browser:
- When you run the app, React renders the component tree starting from `<App />` into `<div id="root"></div>`.
- The browser displays the UI, styled by the CSS loaded in `index.html` and imported in JS files.

## Summary:
- `index.html` sets up the static shell and root div.
- `index.tsx` boots up React and renders `<App />`.
- `<App />` and its children build the UI, which is displayed in the browser.
